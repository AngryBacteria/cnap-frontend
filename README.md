# CNAP Website

CNAP is the name of our long term friendgroup. This project is a website for this
friendgroup. The idea is to have all sorts of features that could be useful.
It is still under construction, but when finished these features should be implemented

- Home-Page with information about all core-members of the CNAP and the features of the website
- User-Accounts with Firebase
- Statistics about all League of Legends matches and profiles of the CNAP
  - This includes individual information on members but also leaderboards
  - Additionally matches from other non CNAP Players should also be supported
  - Information on the lore of the Champions from the game
- Information about the Pen and Paper adventures of the CNAP
  - This includes mainly Das schwarze Auge (DSA) but also some Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) and maybe
    some Stars without Numbers (SWN)

The main developers are

- [AngryBacteria](https://github.com/AngryBacteria)
